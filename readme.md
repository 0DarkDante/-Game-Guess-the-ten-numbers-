# Game "Guess the ten numbers"


** The essence of the game: the computer randomly guesses ten numbers. In the allotted time, namely thirty seconds, it is important to guess these numbers by clicking on them (numbers from one to one hundred).

** When pressed correctly, the number is highlighted in green, and when pressed incorrectly, in red.

** If the time is up, a corresponding inscription appears on the timer city and it is impossible to press any button. To start over, simply refresh the page.

** If you have guessed all ten numbers, a congratulatory text appears instead of a timer.
